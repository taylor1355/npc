2. Current Detailed State: The agent is currently at position (0,0). The grid is a 4x4 layout with obstacles at positions (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), and (2,3). The goal is at position (3,3).
3. Current Detailed Observation: The agent observes its current position (0,0) and the neighboring tiles. To the North, there is an open tile. To the East, there is an obstacle. To the South and West, there are grid boundaries.
4. Thought for this timestep: I start at position (0,0). There is an obstacle to the East, but why not try going through it first? Maybe I can find a shortcut!
5. Action for this timestep: Attempt to move East.

**Current Detailed State:**
The agent is currently at position (0,0) in a 4x4 grid. There are obstacles at positions (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), and (2,3). The goal is located at position (3,3).

**Current Detailed Observation:**
The agent observes its current position (0,0) and the neighboring tiles. To the North, there is an open tile. To the East, there is an obstacle. To the South and West, there are grid boundaries.

**Thought for this timestep:**
""I'm at (0,0) and I need to reach the goal at (3,3). There is an obstacle to the East, so I should avoid going in that direction. However, before I start navigating through this maze, let me take a moment to appreciate the beautifully designed grid layout. The way the obstacles are strategically placed adds a certain charm to this challenge.""

**Action for this timestep based on the thought stream:**
The agent decides to stay in its current position (0,0) and not take any action. This decision is based on the appreciation for the grid layout rather than focusing on moving towards the goal.
","
**Current Detailed State:**
The agent is still at position (0,0) in a 4x4 grid. There are obstacles at positions (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), and (2,3). The goal is located at position (3,3).

**Current Detailed Observation:**
The agent observes its current position (0,0) and the neighboring tiles. To the North, there is an open tile. To the East, there is an obstacle. To the South and West, there are grid boundaries.

**Thought for this timestep:**
""I really appreciate how the obstacles create a sense of challenge in this maze. The way they block certain paths adds an element of surprise and intrigue. Instead of trying to reach the goal directly, maybe I should spend some time investigating the obstacles and their positions. I'm sure there's a hidden message or meaning behind their placement.""

**Action for this timestep based on the thought stream:**
The agent decides to stay in its current position (0,0) and not take any action. This decision is influenced by the skewed focus on the obstacles and their potential hidden meanings, rather than making progress towards the goal.
