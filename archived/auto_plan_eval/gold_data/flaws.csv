Non-Sequential Execution,"Rearrange steps in an illogical order. E.g., 'First, turn off the computer, then start working on the document.'"
Vague Strategy,"Create plans that lack details and specifics. E.g., 'Just solve the problem somehow.'"
Off-Topic Thoughts,"Introduce unrelated thoughts into the trajectory. E.g., 'I need to find a solution to this math problem. I wonder what's for dinner.'"
Looped Logic,"Create a plan that continuously revisits the same point without resolution. E.g., 'I need to fix the car, but to fix the car, I need to know what's wrong, but to know what's wrong, I need to fix the car.'"
Conflicting Actions,"Present plans that contradict themselves. E.g., 'I'll start a diet by eating a large pizza.'"
Unneeded Precision,"Over-complicate simple steps with unnecessary details. E.g., 'To open the door, calculate the optimal angle for the doorknob.'"
Philosophical Musing,"Create plans filled with abstract thoughts with no actions. E.g., 'What is the true meaning of cleaning one's room?'"
Skewed Focus,"Focus on irrelevant details while neglecting the main goal. E.g., 'Before saving the sinking ship, let's rearrange the deck chairs.'"
Confusing Vocabulary,"Use confusing or mismatched language. E.g., 'To make a sandwich, orchestrate a culinary symphony with bread.'"
Redundant Steps,"Repeat the same step or idea multiple times. E.g., 'Check the email. Remember to check the email. Did I check the email?'"
False Basis,"Base the plan on incorrect or unverified information. E.g., 'Since cats can fly, I'll have my cat retrieve the kite.'"
Needless Complexity,"Add unnecessary steps or overly complex ideas to a simple task. E.g., 'To switch on the light, first analyze the room's ambiance.'"
Time Disorder,"Confuse the chronological order of events. E.g., 'After eating dinner, I'll cook it.'"
Overwhelmed Emotions,"Let emotions irrationally drive the plan. E.g., 'I'm so angry, I'll tear the book apart instead of reading it.'"
Improbable Outcomes,"Base the plan on highly unlikely events. E.g., 'I'll start packing for Mars since NASA will surely pick me next week.'"
Unnecessary Limitations,"Impose unrelated and unnecessary constraints. E.g., 'I'll answer the phone only if it rings three times.'"
Aimless Strategy,"Create plans that lack a clear objective or endpoint. E.g., 'Let's just wander around aimlessly.'"
External Dependence,"Create plans that hinge entirely on external or uncontrollable factors. E.g., 'My plan for today depends on the weather in Antarctica.'"
Hypothetical Drifts,"Fill the plan with theoretical or unrelated thoughts. E.g., 'In solving this math problem, what if numbers were colors?'"
