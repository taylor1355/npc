# Personality

## Problem Statement

NPCs currently make decisions based on needs and context, but lack consistent personality that would make individuals distinct. Every NPC responds similarly to similar situations. Personality would create behavioral consistency within individuals while maintaining variety across the population.

## Status: Requires Literature Review

This feature requires research into:
- Psychology and cognitive science literature on personality
- How personality influences decision-making and behavior
- Computational models of personality in AI agents
- The relationship between personality, emotion, and memory
- Personality development and change over time

## Placeholder Thoughts

The system might involve:
- Individual differences that persist across situations
- Influence on decision-making, memory, and social interaction
- Emergence from or interaction with emotional systems
- Consistency within individuals, variety across population

Advanced version:
- Personality that evolves through experience
- Tied to memory and reflection systems
- Traumatic or transformative events causing personality shifts
- Gradual change through repeated experiences

But these are speculative without proper research into the psychological foundations.

## Dependencies

- Basic decision-making system
- Memory and reflection systems (for evolution)
- Potentially emotional modeling system
- Social interaction system

## Priority Rationale

**Obviousness**: Low - Requires understanding psychological principles.

**Development Velocity**: Negative
- Adds another layer to decision-making
- Increases complexity of balancing influences
- Must integrate with needs, context, memory
- Net: Negative - adds complexity without enabling new features

**Concreteness**: Very high - Players immediately notice and strongly appreciate distinct NPC personalities. One of the most player-visible features.

This needs proper research before becoming actionable.
