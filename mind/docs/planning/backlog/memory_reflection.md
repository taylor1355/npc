# Memory Reflection and Consolidation

## Problem Statement

NPCs accumulate memories but never process or learn from them. Humans consolidate experiences during downtime, extracting patterns and updating beliefs. Without reflection, NPCs can't learn from experience or develop wisdom over time.

## Design Goals

- Periodic processing of recent memories to extract insights
- Update beliefs and preferences based on experiences
- Identify patterns in social interactions
- Consolidate similar memories to manage storage

## Technical Approach

### Reflection Triggers

- During sleep or rest periods
- After significant events
- When memory approaches capacity
- During quiet moments

### Reflection Process

1. **Review Recent Memories**: Examine last day/week of experiences
2. **Pattern Extraction**: Identify recurring themes or situations
3. **Belief Updates**: Adjust understanding of world and others
4. **Memory Consolidation**: Merge similar memories into abstractions

### Insight Generation

Create higher-order memories from patterns:
- "The baker is generous" (from multiple positive interactions)
- "Markets are crowded on weekends" (from repeated observations)
- "I work better in the morning" (from tracking productivity)

## Benefits

- **Character Growth**: NPCs develop and change based on experience
- **Memory Efficiency**: Consolidation reduces storage needs
- **Emergent Wisdom**: NPCs learn from mistakes and successes
- **Social Learning**: Understanding of others improves over time

## Dependencies

- Working memory system
- Basic memory with importance scoring
- Quiet periods in daily routines

## Priority Rationale

**Obviousness**: Low - Many ways to implement reflection, no clear best approach.

**Development Velocity**: Negative
- Short-term: Adds complex processing layer with timing and triggering logic
- Long-term: Doesn't accelerate development of other features
- Tech tree: Learning behaviors are mostly independent, not building blocks
- Complexity: Reflection timing, insight generation, belief updates add edge cases
- Net: Negative - adds complexity without making other features easier

**Concreteness**: Moderate - Players notice when NPCs learn from experience and reference past patterns, but effect is subtle and emerges over time.

Reflection is essential for NPCs that truly learn, but adds complexity without simplifying other systems.
