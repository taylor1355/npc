# Behavioral Chunking

## Problem Statement

NPCs need reusable behavioral patterns that can be composed dynamically. Currently, each behavior is generated from scratch. The concept of "chunking" from cognitive science suggests that complex behaviors are built from simpler, learned patterns.

## Status: Requires Literature Review

This feature requires research into:
- Cognitive science literature on chunking and procedural memory
- How humans compose complex behaviors from simpler patterns
- Existing work on behavioral composition in AI agents
- The relationship between chunking and habit formation

## Placeholder Thoughts

The system might involve:
- Learning common behavioral sequences through repetition
- Composing complex behaviors from simpler chunks
- Context-dependent chunk activation
- Gradual refinement of chunks through use

But these are speculative without proper research into the cognitive science foundations.

## Priority Rationale

**Obviousness**: Low - Requires understanding cognitive science principles.

**Development Velocity**: Unknown pending research
- Could dramatically reduce token usage if chunks can be reused
- Might add significant complexity if poorly designed
- Needs careful API design to avoid becoming a bottleneck

**Concreteness**: Unknown - Depends on implementation quality.

This needs proper research before becoming actionable.
