**Needs:**
- Needs range from 0-100, where **100 = fully satisfied, 0 = completely depleted**
- **High values (70-100) = satisfied**, no urgency
- **Medium values (30-69) = declining**, should consider addressing
- **Low values (0-29) = critical**, high priority
- Example: Hunger at 75% means well-fed, Hunger at 25% means very hungry
